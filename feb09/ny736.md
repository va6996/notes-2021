# Introduction
Present an overview of the problem and the approaches.

# Motivation
What is the problem that the papers are looking at, and why are they looking at
this? 
This is a bit harder for the two introduction lectures, since they try to
overview the area.

# Approaches
Talk a bit about the approaches the papers discussed, and what you found from
your research.

# Trade-Offs
Compare the approaches, discuss when they might be appropriate. For example,
some techniques might only make sense with a lot of data, or in the absence of
multiple tenants, etc.

# Open Questions and Future Work
How are the current trends affecting the area, what are some open questions
about the problem, etc.
